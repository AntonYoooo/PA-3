# PA-3-Pandas
This repository includes the solution to programming problems using the Pandas Library. 

## Problems
#### 1. CSV DataFrame Loader and Row Viewer
The main goal for this problem is to load the csv file named cars into data frames using panda, and display the first and last 5 rows of the resulting cars. 

#### 2. Slicing, Subsetting, and Indexing
After successfully loading `cars.csv`, the following instructions should then be executed via utilization of subsetting, slicing, and indexing operations:
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars.
b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models
